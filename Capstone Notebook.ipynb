    "<p>An entrepreneurial ecosystem consists of stakeholders such as non profits, government, academia, private practitioners, financial institutions, among other support organizations. These stakeholders provide support in different areas such as education, access to capital, prototyping and even business plan. In order to maximize the resources of these support organizations they should know the business stage, size, and industry of the client they are helping. Specially, they should consider the location of the business since that data provides an additional layer of context. \n",
